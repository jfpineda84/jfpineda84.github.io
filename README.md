# Portfolio Website  - Week 03 HW
## Description

Personal website where you can view my contact information as well as some of my current and past projects i'm working on or have worked on. 

The main purpose of this website is to aid future employers with a snapshot at my professional background and code. Furthermore, it is a good place to learn more about who i am past the code. You can access this website at .

This website has been build using Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. 


## Synopsis

The first step to this project, was to research different ideas of websites, looking at the aesthetics, layout and simplicity. 

I followed by drawing out the wireframe/ boxing structure which allowed me to understand how the future HTML code should be written (This website was first developed with a single HTML and CSS file which you can find it [here](https://github.com/jfpineda84/Personal-Website)).

To implement the techniques i have learned since then, i have created this version of the site implementing Ruby on Rails with page controllers, and the implementation of [Rails Layout Gem](https://github.com/RailsApps/rails_layout) to aid me with  “Best Practice” HTML5 boilerplate standards.

This allowed me easily to `<render>` much of the repeated information, thus “DRY-ing” the code, something i had a hard time managing with the [first version](https://github.com/jfpineda84/Personal-Website) of the site. 

For the styling, I utilized CSS properties such as flex box to manipulate HTML divs and be able to arrange the contents properly.
